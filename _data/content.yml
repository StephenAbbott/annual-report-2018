- section: Message from Leadership
  text: |
    This year has been an important year of transitions and laying of new foundations for Open Knowledge International (OKI). With the departure of our chief executive officer at the end of 2017, our chief product officer and chief operating officer stepped up jointly into that role. This was supported by Karin Christiansen, our board chair, who joined the leadership team as executive director and to help us complete the search for a new CEO. Which we are delighted to say has been a great success.
    
    The purpose and mission of OKI remain the same: realising open data’s value to society by helping civil society groups access and use data to take action on social problems. However the challenges facing the open agenda are perhaps the greatest in the movement’s history. We have moved through an era of widespread support and understanding for our cause at the highest levels of governments, such as the USA and UK. We now face a situation which is increasingly closed. This closing down is affecting many sectors from those working on the future of the internet to trade and includes the challenges that key data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things are presenting to our society and economy. This turnaround has happened faster than anyone could have anticipated. Now we need to work out how best to respond to counter these trends. 

    In addition to the successful work outlined below, a key feature of this year for OKI has been making sure we are ready to face the challenges that 2019 brings. We are delighted to have appointmented our new CEO Catherine Stihler. Her history of work for the European Parliament on digital policy, prioritising the digital single market, digital skills, better accessibility of digital products for the disabled, as well as citizen online data protection and privacy, will be of great inspiration and value for our organisation in the years to come. Catherine is supported by a [refreshed Board](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/07/23/welcoming-our-new-open-knowledge-international-board/) with a huge breadth of skills and experience, a clarity of focus on our organisational competencies and a refreshed approach to building out opportunities which deliver on our mission through strong partnerships and exceptional delivery.

    ### Frictionless Data
    With [Frictionless Data](http://frictionlessdata.io/), we focus specifically on reducing friction around discoverability, structure, standardisation and tooling. More generally, the technicalities around the preparation, validation and sharing of data - in ways that both enhance existing workflows and enable new ones - towards the express goal of minimising the gap between data and insight. We do this by creating [specifications](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) and [software](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) that are primarily informed by reuse (of existing formats and standards), conceptual minimalism, and platform-agnostic interoperability.

    ![Frictionless Data](img/fd-logo.png)

    In March we published the [Frictionless Data Field Guide](https://frictionlessdata.io/field-guide/) providing step-by-step instructions for improving data publishing workflows. The field guide introduces new ways of working informed by the Frictionless Data suite of software that data publishers can use independently, or adapt into existing personal and organisational workflows.

     ![Field guide](img/Fieldguide.png)

    In July, we [announced funding from the Sloan Foundation](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/07/12/sloan-foundation-funds-frictionless-data-for-reproducible-research/) which we have used to iterate on our work to date and to facilitate deeper integration of the Frictionless Data approach in a range of tools and workflows that enable in reproducible research. We’re also focussing on researchers themselves to support them in becoming trainers and evangelists of the tools in their field(s). 
    
    “Ensuring data availability alone is insufficient for the true potential of open data to be realised. The push from journals and funders at the moment is to encourage sharing, which is the first step towards reuse. The next step is to consider how we ensure actually reusable data. Any efforts to make it easier for researchers to prepare high quality reusable datasets, and to do so with minimal effort, are welcome. Further, tools that reduce the burden of reviewing datasets are of interest to data publishers.” - Naomi Penfold eLife

    ### OpenSpending and the Fiscal Data Package
    Making government finances more transparent remained one of our key programmes of work in 2018. In close partnership with the Global Initiative of Fiscal Transparency ([GIFT](http://fiscaltransparency.net/)) we further developed our light-weight specification that models Fiscal data, the [Fiscal Data Package Specification](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/blob/master/specs/fiscal-data-package.md). In May we [announced](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/05/28/introducing-version-1-of-the-fiscal-data-package-specification/) the version 1 of this specification, after an extensive period of testing the specification with a variety of diverse fiscal data sources. The specification is built on the philosophy that it should be flexible and adaptable to the format in which data is being published by governments around the world.

    Working closely with GIFT we work with national governments ranging from Croatia to Mexico and from South Africa to Argentina, to help them publish their budgets in the Fiscal Data Package format. The resulting data is all available on our central portal [OpenSpending](https://openspending.org/), which provides easy ways to find data with the [OS Explorer](https://openspending.org/s/); multiple ways of visualising the data out-of-the-box via the OS Viewer; as well as a sophisticated API for more technical users of the data. 

    ![OS viewer](img/fiscal.png)

    In 2019 we will continue to work closely with both publishers and users of government budget and spending data. Please get in touch with us via [openspending-support@okfn.org](mailto:openspending-support@okfn.org) if you would like to learn more or discuss a potential collaboration.

    ### School of Data
    [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) is a global network dedicated to advancing data literacy in civil society. Since 2012, we have been working with CSOs and journalists to amplify their work with data: raising awareness of its possibilities and teaching the skills required, and training trainers how to pass this knowledge on.

    ![Data](img/data.jpg)

     In 2018, we ran the sixth edition of our annual fellowship programme, in which we aim to recruit and train the next generation of data leaders and trainers to magnify the reach of our data literacy programme. This year, we continued the thematic approach pioneered by the 2016 class and therefore recruited individuals who already possessed experience in a specific area of data literacy training - for example: extractives data - and with established practitioners already working within this field. We recruited some fantastic applicants for our class of 2018 fellows who are based in Bolivia, Tanzania, Guatemala, Kenya, Malawi, the Philippines, Ghana and Indonesia. We partnered with organisations interested in working on the fellows’ respective themes in the region local to them, who have provided the fellows with guidance, mentorship and expertise.

    Instead of our annual Summer Camp, this year we held two events in Nairobi, Kenya and Manila, the Philippines. In both cases, members of our coordination team travelled out to meet up with groups of fellows for onboarding, workshopping and mapping out the shape of each fellow’s programme. This also gave the fellows an opportunity to meet their peers, build contacts and share their skills. 

    In other highlights, we designed and produced a [modular curriculum](https://school-of-data.github.io/lgticurriculum/) to develop foundational data skills for students and trainers of the Local Government Training Institute in Tanzania. We did a training in Washington DC for the Data Collaboratives for Local Impact Fellows, building on the work we did with the organisation in 2017. In September, in Buenos Aires, we gave a joint talk with representatives of the World Bank and DataKind UK at the [International Open Data Conference](https://www.opendatacon.org/). And finally our coordination team expanded as we welcomed Yan Naung Oak, a former fellow whom we are delighted to now have working on delivering the class of 2018’s programme!

    ### Case studies
    For over a decade we have been drawing on experience in technology, training, policy, and research; pioneering openness in new areas. In 2018 we published a number of case studies highlighting our work in different areas:
    
    - Facilitating data validation and reuse
    We worked with eLife to assess the quality of this published data and a way to identify issues to inform a strategy for improving data quality.
    - Versatile visualisation of open budget data
    We worked with IBP to build an interactive Data Explorer that allows users to visualise and interact with the data from current and previous surveys.
    - Creating an open data publication toolkit
    Details how anyone interested in publishing data can use the Frictionless Data software to improve the quality of their datasets.
    - Celebrating open data with communities across the world
    Open Data Day is an annual event organised by the open data community, which Open Knowledge International helps support and catalyse.
    - Building an open database of information on all clinical trials
    We worked with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine to build OpenTrials, an open database of information about the world’s clinical research trials.
    - Frictionless publication and use of fiscal data
    Anyone should be able access and analyse all fiscal data they are interested in easily. So Open Knowledge International developed the Fiscal Data Package.
    - Mapping the state of open government data across the globe
    Launched in 2013, the Global Open Data Index was the first major assessment of the state of open government data in the world.

    ### Route-to-PA
    The [ROUTE-TO-PA project](http://routetopa.eu/) – Raising Open and User-friendly Transparency-Enabling Technologies fOr Public Administrations – is an 11 partner network aiming to make it easier to socially interact online about open data. The project supports municipalities in their approach of using the tools SPOD (Social Platform for Open Data) and TET (Transparency-Enhancing Toolset) and include them in projects around open data. The deadline of the Horizon 2020 project was successfully extended to end of May 2018, thus guaranteeing a more tangible and effective outcome of the project.

    ![routetopa](img/routetopa-video.png)

    In 2017 we supported the city of Dublin in their community scenarios (such as [Pin it in the Parks](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/11/24/pin-it-in-the-parks-crowdsourcing-park-facilities-information-in-dublin/)) that had as a goal to to utilize SPOD by inviting citizens to map park facilities. Currently the topics that shape out in the community scenarios are sustainable livelihood (municipality of Utrecht, the Netherlands), cultural heritage (municipalities of Hetor, Italy and Issy in France)  and budget participation (municipality of Prato, Italy). We took a lead on creating more attractive dissemination material that make Route-toPA more appealing and not fallen out of time. We also worked on shaping a business model canvas.

    ### FutureTDM
    In the summer of 2017 the [FutureTDM project](http://www.futuretdm.eu/) successfully completed its’ two-year EC-funded research investigating what’s holding Europe back in adopting technologies for text and data mining – using algorithms to analyse content in ways that would be impossible for humans. The project consortium, consisting of 10 European partners led by SYNYO, met with stakeholders and experts from all over Europe, gathering input and carrying out research to understand how Europe can take steps to support the uptake of TDM. Open Knowledge International together with ContentMine led the work on communication, mobilisation and networking and undertook research into best practices and methodologies. The final results were presented in a [symposium](https://blog.core.okfn.org/2017/07/13/futuretdm-symposium-sharing-project-findings-policy-guidelines-and-practitioner-recommendations/) in June 2017 and published as a summary [press release](https://blog.core.okfn.org/2017/09/12/this-is-what-europe-can-do-to-stimulate-text-and-data-mining/) in September 2017.

    ![FutureTDM](img/futureTDM poll.png)

    ### Open Data for Tax Justice
    Launched in 2016, the [Open Data for Tax Justice project](http://datafortaxjustice.net/) aimed to create a global network of people and organisations using open data to improve advocacy, journalism and public policy around tax justice. In collaboration with our expert network, we published two research papers during 2017: one focused on a roadmap towards [creating a global database of public country-by-country reporting](http://datafortaxjustice.net/what-do-they-pay/) (CBCR) and the other used data to decide [which jurisdictions should have featured on the European Union’s tax haven blacklist](http://datafortaxjustice.net/paradiselost/).

    ![od4tj](img/od4tj-bg.jpg)

    To pursue these topics, our team [convened a meeting](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/07/27/open-data-for-tax-justice-design-sprint-building-a-pilot-database-of-public-country-by-country-reporting/) to take steps towards creating a pilot of the CBCR database while also joining advocacy efforts to get European Union countries to [release more public CBCR data](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/05/29/why-meps-should-vote-in-favour-of-releasing-public-country-by-country-reporting-as-open-data/). More recently, in the wake of the [Paradise Papers investigations](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/), we highlighted [how a push towards public CBCR](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/11/22/why-public-country-by-country-reporting-should-be-introduced-in-the-uk-and-across-europe/) could help governments address some of the issues raised by this global exposé. We also spread the word about open data and tax justice by participating in the annual conferences of the [Tax Justice Network](https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/06/29/tax-justice-network-annual-conference-2017-5-6-july-final-programme/) and [Financial Transparency Coalition](https://financialtransparency.org/conferences/tipping-point/).

    ### Open Data for Development
    Open Knowledge International is a member of [Open Data for Development (OD4D)](http://od4d.net/), a global network of leaders in the open data community, working together to develop open data solutions around the world. We manage the Africa Open Data Collaboration Fund and the OD4D Embedded Fellowship programme. Through the support of the Open Data for Development partnership, we helped to organise the first African Francophone Conference on Open Data (CAFDO 2017), in collaboration with  the Ministry of Development of the Digital Economy (MDENP) through the National Agency for the Promotion of ICTs in Burkina Faso. The event brought together more than a hundred people, among them were representatives from 22 countries in Africa and Europe. Among them; Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Ghana, Egypt, France, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Mauritania, Niger, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Tunisia, Chad and Togo.

    Building from successful embedded fellows in 2016, we partnered with CENOZO in West Africa and the PPDC in Nigeria to support two embedded fellowships. Over the course of the programme, PPDC trainers ran [9 data training sessions](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B9vzxIvZeBaFdzFLWldMWGo0X1k) to teach the skills identified and needed by the ICIR journalists. The journal PPDC trainers also produced a [session journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IlnHQP3fXDTdCZb3jjQq7h5bBBLopW9F0fwKTsem8Ac/edit) detailing what was achieved in each of these training sessions. In addition, PPDC and ICIR are working on the [beginnings of a data strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qVct2uxilvETBg2Ia4yKJR_H5qkqKB8C0qP_id6aNvE/edit), which will be developed over the next few months and is designed to ensure that ICIR continues to build their capacity to use data effectively. In Burkina Faso (fellow based in Ghana), our fellow worked with the host organisation, CENOZO, to develop resources and train regional investigative journalists on reporting on beneficial ownership.

  text: |
    ### Open Knowledge Network
    [The Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/network/) further developed in 2017. We welcomed [Nepal](http://oknp.org) as a new chapter and sadly said goodbye to Spain, who disbanded their organisation. There are now 11 formal Open Knowledge Chapters part of the network, and in additional we have national groups in 19 other countries. There are 5 affiliate organisations part of the network, who do not use the name Open Knowledge but subscribe to the same values and principles.
    
    We also launched new [project participation guidelines](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/08/21/fostering-open-inclusive-and-respectful-participation/), which spells out our expectations when taking part in our activities. These are aiming to help us move towards developing more inclusive and diverse communities, where everyone who wants to participate respectfully feels welcomed to do so.

    ### Open Knowledge Labs
    [Open Knowledge Labs](http://okfnlabs.org/) exists at the interface between Open Knowledge International and its developer community. We communicate primarily through our Open Knowledge Labs blog, forums, and chat rooms. Historically, the blog has hosted tips and tricks for working with data from across our community.

    This past year, we have used the [blog](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/) as the primary means of distributing new releases, tutorials, and walkthroughs from our Frictionless Data project.

    ### Open Knowledge International Events
    #### Open Data Day 2017
    [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) is the yearly event where we gather to reach out to new people and build new solutions to issues in our communities using open data. Saturday 4 March 2017 marked the 7th edition. In this year, the community has grown and evolved greatly: more than 300 events were registered around the world. We had the support of Hivos, Article19, SPARC and Hewlett to provide mini-grants for organising events in four tracks: Open Research, Open Data for Human Rights, Open Data for Environment and Open Contracting and Tracking Public Money Flows. We received more than 200 applications and were able to [support 44 events](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/02/24/announcing-the-2017-international-open-data-day-mini-grant-winners/), some of which in places that hosted an Open Data Day event for the first time. Following a blogging series on these and other Open Data Day events, we posted a [summary blog with a lookback on Open Data Day 2017](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/05/11/a-lookback-on-open-data-day-2017/) in early May.

    ![OD2017](img/map-ODD_2017.png)

    #### Csv,conf,v3
    The third manifestation of everyone’s favorite community conference about data - [csv,conf,v3](https://csvconf.com/) - happened in May 2017 at Eliot Center, Portland, Oregon. The conference brought together data makers/doers/hackers from various backgrounds to share knowledge and stories about data in a relaxed, convivial, alpaca-friendly (see below) environment. Several of our staff working across our Frictionless Data, OpenSpending, and Open Data for Development projects made the journey to Portland to help organize, give talks, and exchange stories about our lives with data and hear keynotes delivered by Laurie Allen, Heather Joseph, Mike Bostock, and Angela Bassa who provided a great framing for the conference through their insightful talks.

- section: Research Highlights
  text: |
    We study how to realise the potential of open knowledge for the public good. Grounded in the informational needs of individuals and organisations, we develop methods to study data use, investigate what makes information useful and usable, explore ways of organising and collaborating around information, and follow policies to unlock key data for society.

    Our research is undertaken in-house, for and in collaboration with civil society groups, universities, journalists, policy-makers, and public institutions. In 2017 we published the following reports:

    - [Report Data and the City: How can public data infrastructures change lives in urban regions?](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/02/09/data-and-the-city-new-report-on-how-public-data-is-fostering-civic-engagement-in-urban-regions/)
    - [Report What do they pay? Towards a Public Database to Account for the Economic Activities and Tax Contributions of Multinational Corporations](http://datafortaxjustice.net/what-do-they-pay/)
    - [Report: Governing by Rankings: How the Global Open Data Index helps advance the open data agendas](https://research.okfn.org/governing-by-rankings/)
    - [Report: Avoiding Data Use Silos - How Governments Can Simplify The Open Licensing Landscape](https://research.okfn.org/avoiding-data-use-silos/)
    - [Blogpost: Understanding the costs of scholarly publishing – Why we need a public data infrastructure of publishing costs](https://blog.okfn.org/2017/10/24/understanding-the-costs-of-scholarly-publishing-why-we-need-a-public-data-infrastructure-of-publishing-costs/)

    ![licensing](img/silos.png)

    In 2018 we look forward to expanding our portfolio of research investigating three focus areas:

    - Data use: We will address conceptual challenges arising from open data: How to identify data users and broader ‘data audiences’, that is topical experts with potential needs for data? What methodological tools can adequately grasp ‘data use’ as well as other forms of engagement with information? Our research includes to investigate the necessary qualities making data fit for purpose.
    - Collaborative data and data commons: Our new focus on collaborative data appraises the need for well-designed cross-sectoral, collaborative models of producing and using data. Yet, there is a lack of theoretically and empirically rigorous investigation into the labour division composing and maintaining data collaborations. What aspects distinguish different community architectures? By what means is participation, engagement and data ownership currently governed in data collaborations?
    - Information politics: Technologies to capture and manage data are embedded in shifting regulatory and policy landscapes. As Open Knowledge International continues to push for openness and the public value of data, it is important to monitor how these landscapes evolve. Which policy tools and advocacy strategies could enable public access and reuse of data held by private entities and others? a.
